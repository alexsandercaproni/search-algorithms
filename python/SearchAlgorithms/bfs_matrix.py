        Constructor
        Any object instance must receive an ``problem`` parameter that is responsible
        for controlling the problem evaluation and next possible solutions. This parameter
        have two required functions:
            
            ExpandSolution(current): function that returns all possible solutions from 
            ``current`` state
            TestObjective(current,target): function that evaluates if ``current`` state
            corresponds to the ``target`` state

        This method is responsible for checking if a ``current_state`` was already
        visited during search. In this case is necessary to compare ``current_state``
        with all states in ``visited_states`` list, one by one. In order to perform 
        comparison, user must provide the ``EqualityTest`` function inside problem 
        object.
